            The main purpose is to share the knowledge gained over the years and
            get an engineer out of you. The content in this website will make
            you a full stack developer! Expect content revolving around the
            following languages:
            <ul>
              <li>The Java programming language</li>
              <li>JavaScript programming language</li>
              <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>
            The development stack that I teach will involve:
            <ul>
              <li>A Spring boot backend</li>
              <li>A React front end</li>
              <li>
                And other items in my stack e.g Thymeleaf, gatsby, TailwindCSS

            <h3>My story</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Victor Mwangi Wairimu is a tech enthusiast from Kenya. I never
                was a nerd in highschool - or so I thought - but managed to
                qualify for an engineering course at{" "}
                <a href="https://www.mku.ac.ke/">Mount Kenya University</a>. I
                completed a Bachelor of Technology in Computer and Electronics
                Systems on Dec 17, 2021. I should probably include lessons on 
                electronics here but I don't want to scare anyone with mathematics ðŸ˜—,
                'yet'.

            <h3>My development story</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                With the most of my coursework focusing on hardware and systems
                programming, I had to teach myself the higher level aspects of
                programming. After all, however focused/hardworking I think I
                was, there was no way I was going to build websites with VHDL,
                assembly language, C, or C++. Selecting what language to study
                at the time was a hectic endeavour, where I studied python, C#,
                Java and JavaScript in that order. Of course Java clicked and
                JavaScript ... well, JavaScript is JavaScript. I forgot the rest
                btw.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a full stack developer, I studied HTML shortly after Java and
                later added JavaScript to my arsenal. My first website had a Java
                servlets backend and JSPs at the front end but after tasting Spring
                Boot magic, I didn't look back.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started this website so you or someone else wouldn't have to
                struggle to be a developer. Also it's worth noting that my mum
                is a teacher but unlike me, she is lucky enough to see and
                interact with her students.
